        <p>The water pump helps coolant flow throughout the engine in order to keep the car from
            overheating.</p>

                scope="external">As described in oreillyauto.com</xref>, water pumps include an
            impeller located in the engine's water channel that is driven by a pulley powered by the
            engineâ€™s belt. If the water pump fails, you may hear squeaking from the water pump
            pulley, or you might notice coolant leaks or steam coming from under the hood, and the
            engine may overheat.</p>
        <p>If the impeller on the pump fails, the coolant is no longer circulated. Most belt-driven
            water pumps have a weep hole that starts to leak fluid when the impeller starts to fail.
            If there is coolant leaking from the water pump, this indicates that it may be failing
            and may need to be replaced.</p>
