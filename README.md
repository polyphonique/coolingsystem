## Documentation Example: DITA Project

### The Cooling System

This repo is the result of my efforts to learn to create DITA documentation in Oxygen XML Editor. I wanted to discover more about how this popular tool is used and why it is so popular with today's technical writers. Here you see my early work as I begin to flesh out my example.

As a theme, I chose to create a car repair manual operating under the principles of the DITA content model. Starting from reference content, I'm creating a framework for the further development of the project.

This repo describes the car's cooling system. I'm starting the process of taking longer repair instructions and chunking that copy into discrete subtasks.
